## ExportExcelFileDemo
---

This is just a quick little demo showing how to export a .xlsx file.  
It uses the NuGet package ***ClosedXML*** to reduce the amount of code needed.  
  
I tried to have as minimal code needed to make it easy to clone and get to work without having  
to scour through the code base to replace hard coded values with dynamic data.  

It is a basic ASP.NET Core MVC app (3.1) with only a small Model class and some additions to the  
HomeController class.  

I recommend that you know your way around ASP.NET Core MVC before using this code.
